# GrandPyBot-P7

PROJET 7 : PARCOURS DA PYTHON OCR

GrandPyBot is a little chatbot.
The website is a simple web page displaying a chat. The user simply taps a message to ask if GrandPy knows a place. GrandPyBot will try to find an exact address.

The user sends a message.
The application uses the scanned message to ask the Google Maps API to pinpoint the address, latitude, and longitude.
The application uses the Mediawiki API to obtain additional information about a nearby location.

The website displays the information found and a mini-map in the chat. 
The application also provides unit tests, written for pytest.
